## Mission

Our mission is to improve the capabilities of expert decision makers by using artificial intelligence to do the hard things.


## Values

These are the values that hold in our lab and with our collaborators.

**Impact**: We undertake projects that aim to benefit people. This means sometimes taking a slow approach to science, while other times being able to rapidly try out ideas to fail early. But the goal is always quality. We publish to share ideas, not just for the sake of publishing.

**Human-centredness**: Our focus is on augmenting and amplifying human potential. We study how people use (and don't use) AI tools. Rather than just measuring accuracy, correctness, computational cost, etc., we also consider factors that amplify people's capabilities, such as **understandability**, **usefulness**, and **confidence**. 

**Collaboration**: Our work is inherently inter-disciplinary because it is problem-driven, not discipline-driven. We work in teams to jointly explore problems and solutions. We communicate often and clearly, share ideas, and help each other, even if it is not directly part of our role.

**Respect**: We respect each other, what every individual brings to a collaboration, their time, their ideas, and their culture. We **listen** to each other, provide constructive (not destructive) feedback, we are on time with meetings & deliverables, or let people know if we will be late.

**Personal wellbeing**: We operate at our best when we are happy in our personal lives and are well rested. Weekends and evenings belong to us, not to our employer. We work hard and smart during work hours, but [self, family, and friends always take priority](/wl_balance/).
