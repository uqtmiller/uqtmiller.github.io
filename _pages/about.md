I am a professor in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), Brisbane, Australia.

My primary area of expertise is in artificial intelligence, with particular emphasis on:

* Human-AI interaction
* AI-assisted decision support
* Explainable AI (XAI)
* Reasoning about action and knowledge

My work is at the intersection of artificial intelligence, interaction design, and cognitive science/psychology. My areas of education expertise are in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and technology innovation.

Prior to my appointment at The University of Queensland, I was a Professor of Computer Science in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), where I was founding co-director of [The Centre for AI and Digital Ethics](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/caide). I am an honorary professor at the University of Melbourne.

# Research supervision/advising

I am currently not taking on any new PhD or MPhil research students.

I receive many queries regarding supervision, many of which are spam. As such, I only respond to queries that I believe are genuine. If you would like to approach me regarding PhD or MPhil supervision, please demonstrate that that your and my research interests are aligned.

Potential PhD/MPhil students: I do not genereally have funding for students. When I do, I advertise and recruit from applicants.

Potential student interns: I do not usually have funding for internships. When I do, I recruit from University of Melbourne students. I am unable to consider any requests for paid internships.
