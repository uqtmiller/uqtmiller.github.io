**News (28 Feb, 2024)**: I'm recruiting [two postdoctorial research fellows in human-centered decsion support](recruitment).

I am a Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), Meaanjin/Brisbane, Australia.

My mission is to use artificial intellignce to amplify the capabilities of expert decision makers.

My research draws on **machine learning, reinforcement learning, AI planning, interaction design, and cognitive science**, to help people to make better decisions.
I have done work on areas **including explainable AI, human-AI mixed-initiative planning**, and **human-centered decision support**.

Prior to my appointment at The University of Queensland, I was a Professor of Computer Science in the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), where I was founding co-director of [The Centre for AI and Digital Ethics](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/caide). I am an honorary professor at the University of Melbourne.

If you are an organisation applying artificial intelligence or looking to apply artificial intelligence, especially in south-east Queensland, [please reach out](mailto:timothy.miller@uq.edu.au). I am always interested to hear what organisations are currently doing, the opportunities and barriers in this space, and how the University of Queensland can help.

If you are prospective PhD student interested in studying for a PhD under my supervisor, [see here](https://uqtmiller.github.io/students/).

## About not me

No, I'm not the guy from the Queen's gambit:

## Recruitment: 2 x postdoc research fellows for 2 years

I'm recruiting two postdocs in human-centered decision support using AI.

The first position is for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with experience in human factors, HCI, psychology, or related area.

The second position if for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with experience in human-centred machine learning. 

### Selection criteria

The successful candidate with have:

**Required**

- Completed (or be near completion) of a PhD in either machine learning or a related area, **OR** HCI, human factors, psychology applied to AI, or a related area.

- An emerging profile in research in the area of human-centered artificial intelligence.

- Evidence of publications in reputed refereed journals and presenting at conferences such as CHI, CSCW, FAccT, AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPs, CVPR, EMNLP, or similar.

- Demonstrated experience in machine learning, such as deep learning for image processes, deep learning for natural language processing, or interpretable machine learning (for machine learning role); **OR** demonstrated experience in human-centred methods, such co-design, participatory design, conducting human behavioural experiments, and conducting field studies (for HCI/human factors/psychology role).

- Experience in conducting human behavioural experiments.

**Desired**

- Evidence of contributions towards successfully obtaining external research funding.

- Demonstrated experience in the area of trust, reliance, explainability/interpretability, decision support, or cognitive/social psychology; as applied to artificial intelligence.

### Considering applying?

If you are considering applying, please first read our [Missions and values](/mission_and_values.md) to ensure that our lab aligns with what you aim to do.
