Our mission is to augment and amplify the capabilities of people and organisations using artificial intelligence. 


## Values

These are the values that hold in our lab and with our collaborators.

**Excellence**: We strive for excellence in what we do. We aim for impact that benefits people. This means sometimes taking a slow approach to science, while other times being able to rapidly try out ideas to fail early. We are open to change and new ideas.

**Human-centredness**: Our focus is on augmenting and amplifying human potential. To do this, we need to study how people use (and don't use) AI tools. Rather than just measuring accuracy, correctness, computational cost, etc., we also consider factors that amplify people, such as **understandability**, **usefulness**, and **confidence**. 

**Collaborative**: Our work is inhernelty inter-disciplinary. We need to work in teams to jointly explore problems and solutions, and be open to new ideas. This means communicating often and communicating clearly, being open, sharing ideas, and helping each other, even if it is not directly part of our role.

**Respect**: We respect each other, what every individual brings to a collaboration, their time, their ideas, and their culture. This means listening to each other, providing constructive (not destructive) feedback, being on time with meetings & deliverables, or letting people know if we will be late.

**Personal wellbeing**: We operate at our best when we are happy in our personal lives and are well rested. Weekends and eveningsbelong to us, not to our employer. We work hard and smart during work hours, but [self, family, and friends always take priority](wl-balance/).
