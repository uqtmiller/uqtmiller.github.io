**NEWS: 11 December, 2023**: I have two PhD scholarships currently being advertised. Applications due 15 January, 2024.

We are particular interested in applicants from areas that are under-represented in computer science, including gender, culture, and geographical location. 

### PhD scholarship 1: Human-centered verification of language model outputs 

**Co-supervisors**: [Dr Joel MacKenzie](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/33810) and [Professor Guido Zuccon](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/22857)

This PhD project will investigate techniques for supporting people to verify the outputs from language models. 
It will investigate techniques from information retrieval to support users to find evidence for/against statements made by language models, to help verify whether they can rely on this information.

The student will take a human-centered approach to verification of model outputs, framing the problem as an [Evaluative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12389) issue. They will work closely with supervisors and external partners to take a user-centred view of how to verify information for tasks such as reviewing machine-generated reports, machine diagnosis, etc.

Selection will be on a competitive basis. 

Selection criteria:

* A qualification and strong background and in computer science or related area (essential).

* Strong software development skills; e.g. version control, using clusters (desirable).

* Demonstrated foundational knowledge and practice in the field/s of data structures, algorithms, and machine learning (essential).

* A desire to work on human-centred AI problems (essential)

* Experience running human behavioural experiments and field trials (desirable).

### PhD scholarship 2: Explainable decision support for skin cancer detection using machine learning

**Co-supervisors**: [Dr Alina Bialkowski](https://sites.google.com/site/alinabialkowski/) and [Professor Peter Soyer, Chair of Dermatology](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/1918)

This PhD project will investigate techniques for improving decision support to dermatologists using explainable computer vision techniques. It will devise novel human-AI interaction methods that support rather than replace human decision-making.

The student will take a human-centered approach to decision support, framing the problem as an [Evaluative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12389) issue. They will work closely with the supervisors to take a dermatologist-centered view of how to detect skin cancers from images such as skin lesions and pathological slides. 

Selection will be on a competitive basis. 

Selection criteria:

* A qualification and strong background and in computer science or related area (essential).

* Strong software development skills; e.g. version control, using clusters (desirable).

* Demonstrated practical experience in the field/s of machine learning, particularly deep learning for computer vision (essential).

* A desire to work on human-centred AI problems (essential)

* Experience running human behavioural experiments and field trials (desirable).

<!--I am currently not taking on any new PhD or MPhil research students.-->

## Direct contact opportunities

I receive many queries regarding supervision, many of which are spam. As such, I only respond to queries that I believe are genuine. If you would like to approach me regarding PhD or MPhil supervision, please demonstrate that that your and my research interests are aligned.

Potential student interns: I do not usually have funding for internships. When I do, I recruit from University of Queensland students. I am unable to consider any requests for paid internships.
