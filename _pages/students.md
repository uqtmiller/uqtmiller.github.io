## Research supervision/advising

I am currently not taking on any new PhD or MPhil research students.

I receive many queries regarding supervision, many of which are spam. As such, I only respond to queries that I believe are genuine. If you would like to approach me regarding PhD or MPhil supervision, please demonstrate that that your and my research interests are aligned.

Potential student interns: I do not usually have funding for internships. When I do, I recruit from University of Queensland students. I am unable to consider any requests for paid internships.
