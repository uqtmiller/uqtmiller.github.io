## Research supervision/advising

Currently I do not have any new funding for PhD scholarships. 

If you have funding for a scholarship and would like to consider applying for a PhD scholarship in our lab, please first read our [Missions and values](/mission_and_values.md)  to ensure that our lab aligns with what you aim to do.

## Direct contact opportunities

I receive many queries regarding supervision, many of which are spam. As such, I only respond to queries that I believe are genuine. If you would like to approach me regarding PhD or MPhil supervision, please demonstrate that that your and my research interests are aligned.

Potential student interns: I do not usually have funding for internships. When I do, I recruit from University of Queensland students. I am unable to consider any requests for paid internships.
