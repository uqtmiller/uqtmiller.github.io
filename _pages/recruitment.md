I'm recruiting two postdocs in area of human-centered decision support using AI.

**Applications close**: Monday 8 December, 2025 at 11.00pm AEST

I'm recruiting two postdoc research fellows to investigate how to design decision support tools that balance the trade off between scalability and human control in defence environments. While recent studies show that centering the human at the centre of the decision-making process leads to improved outcomes, this makes the human a rate-limiting factor.  We aim to design decision support tools to balance this trade off.

One role focuses on machine learning for decision support systems, and the other on human factors/cognitive psychology in AI-based decision support.

The successful candidates will work with the team and an industry partner to design, implement, and evaluate decision support tools, and to run large-scale experiments to evaluate the impact of these tools on decision making.

It is expected that the successful candidates will each contribute to research and some engagement. There will also be opportunities to each part of one course per year and to supervise undergraduate and masters thesis students. This is a valuable opportunity to develop a teaching portfolio and an emerging research portfolio when applying for academic and other research positions in the future.

The position is located at the St Lucia campus in Brisbane, Australia. Flexible working arrangements are possible including hybrid on site/WFH options, part time options, and flexible start/finish times. Fully remote is not available for this position.

✅ Work in wonderful Brisbane—unbeatable lifestyle

✅ Collaborate on cross-disciplinary AI projects with industry partners

✅ Be part of an exciting and unique set of projects tackling the foundations of real-world problems

## Selection criteria

**For both positions:**

* Completion or near completion of a PhD in human-centred AI, human factors/cognitive psychology for decision support, or closely related area.

* Openness to working on defence-related projects, related to decision support in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

* Ability to start the position around February-March 2026.

**Criteria for Position in Machine Learning for Decision Support Systems:**

* Evidence of peer-reviewed publications in reputed refereed journals/conferences in machine learning/artificial intelligence, especially for decision support, situation awareness, information seeking, etc.

* Demonstrated experience in using machine learning, including for image processing.

* Demonstrated software engineering/development abilities, and the use of tools for software engineering.

**Criteria for Position in Human Factors/Cognitive Psychology in AI-Based Decision Support:**

* Evidence of peer-reviewed publications in reputed refereed journals/conferences in human factors or cognitive science/psychology, especially as applied to AI decision support, situation awareness, information seeking, etc.

* Demonstrated expertise in applying models of higher-order cognitive processing, such as decision making, situation awareness, information seeking, etc.

* Demonstrated experience in designing and running large-scale human behavioural experiments.
