I'm recruiting a postdoc in area of human-centered decision support using AI

**Applications close**: Saturday 4 October, 2025 at 11.00pm AEST

This position is for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to investigate how to design decision support tools that balance the trade off between scalability and human control. While recent studies show that centering the human at the centre of the decision-making process leads to improved outcomes, this makes the human a rate-limiting factor.  We aim to design decision support tools to balance this trade off.

The successful candidates will work with the team and external medical/clinical experts to design, implement, and evaluate decision support tools, and to run large-scale experiments to evaluate the impact of these tools on decision making.

It is expected that the successful candidates will each contribute to research and some engagement. There will also be opportunities to each part of one course per year and to supervise undergraduate and masters thesis students. This is a valuable opportunity to develop a teaching portfolio and an emerging research portfolio when applying for academic and other research positions in the future.

The position is located at the St Lucia campus in Brisbane, Australia. Flexible working arrangements are possible including hybrid on site/WFH options, part time options, and flexible start/finish times. Fully remote is not available for this position.

✅ Work in wonderful Brisbane—unbeatable lifestyle
✅ Collaborate on cross-disciplinary AI projects
✅ Visa sponsorship & relocation support available

## Selection criteria

The successful candidate with have:

**Required**:

* Completion or near completion of a PhD in human-centred AI or closely related area.

* Evidence of human-centred AI publications in reputed refereed journals and presenting at conferences such as AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPs, CVPR, EMNLP, CHI, CSCW, FAccT, or similar.

* Experience in conducting human behavioural experiments or human-centered field studies.
