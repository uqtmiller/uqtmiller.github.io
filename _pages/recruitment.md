I'm recruiting a postdoc (women applicants only) in area of human-centered decision support using AI.

**Applications close**: Sunday, 24th November 2024 at 11.00pm AEST

This position is for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow to investigate how to design decision support tools to mitigate skills erosion and promote skill development. Studies show that automation and AI decision support tools erode people's skills, or don't build them up to begin with. This leaves people with less to fall back on when something goes wrong. We aim to design decision support tools to mitigate this problem.

The successful candidates will work with the team and external experts to design, implement, and evaluate decision support tools, and to run large-scale experiments and field studies to evaluate the impact of these tools on skill development and skill erosion. 

It is expected that the successful candidates will each contribute to research, some engagement, and to teaching part of one course per year or supervise thesis students. This is a valuable opportunity to develop a teaching portfolio and an emerging research portfolio when applying for academic and other research positions in the future.

The position is located at the St Lucia campus in Brisbane, Australia. Flexible working arrangements are possible including hybrid on site/WFH options, part time options, and flexible start/finish times. Fully remote is not available for this position.

The position is only open to women, gender diverse applicants and those who identify as women.

## Selection criteria

The successful candidate with have:

**Required**:

* Completion or near completion of a PhD in human-centred AI or closely related area.

* Evidence of human-centred AI publications in reputed refereed journals and presenting at conferences such as AAAI, IJCAI, NeurIPs, CVPR, EMNLP, CHI, CSCW, FAccT, ICIS, HICSS, ECIS, or similar.

* Exerience in conducting human behavioural experiments or human-centered field studies.
